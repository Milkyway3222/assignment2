            <h3>The Power of Building Side Projects</h3>
            <p>Date: March 12, 2025</p>
            <p>Category: Computer Science and Learning</p>
            <p>One of the best ways to grow as a computer scientist is by building things outside of class. Side projects let you experiment with new frameworks, practice problem-solving, and create something tangible you can showcase.
                Whether it’s a small Python script that automates a boring task, a web app that solves a niche problem, or a machine learning model trained on a fun dataset, side projects help bridge the gap between theory and practice.

            <h3>The Beauty of Clean Code</h3>
            <p>April,2 2025</p>
            <p>Software Development</p>
            <p>When you first start programming, the goal is usually just to make the code work. But over time, you realize that how the code is written matters just as much as whether it runs. Clean code is about clarity, readability, and maintainability. It’s the difference between a project that feels like a puzzle only its creator can solve and one that anyone can pick up and understand.
                Writing clean code isn’t about following rigid rules; it’s about respecting the next person who will read it — which might even be your future self. Thoughtful naming, consistent structure, and simplicity over cleverness all contribute to code that tells a story rather than hides one.
                The reward of clean code is longevity. Projects built with care are easier to expand, debug, and share. In the end, clean code isn’t just a technical skill — it’s a form of craftsmanship that reflects how much you value the work you create.

            <h3>Why Storytelling Matters in Tech Portfoilios</h3>
            <p>May 8, 2025</p>
            <p>Career and Personal Branding</p>
            <p>A portfolio isn’t just a GitHub repo full of code — it’s a story about how you think as a computer scientist. Employers and collaborators want to see not only what you built, but why you built it and how you solved the problem.
                For example, instead of just listing “Built a sorting algorithm in C++,” explain the challenge: Did you optimize for memory? Did you compare time complexities? Did you visualize the results? That context transforms a project from a line of code into a demonstration of problem-solving ability.
